## The SDMX Web-Services Namespace

The SDMX Web Services namespace (i.e., the declared namespace of the SDMX WSDL definition) contains a set of messages specific to the use of SOAP-based services. Each of the operations described will have a message to invoke the Web-Service, and a response message. In each case, these are refinements of other SDMX messages, appropriate to the operation being performed â€“ these are described in the list of operations, below.

Additionally, there is a list of error codes to be used in the SOAP envelope (see the standard error codes section).
